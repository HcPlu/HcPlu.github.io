    <p >Game AI</p>
  </h2>
    <p>
      Game AI is a subfield of AI that is concerned with the study of artificial intelligence methods and techniques in games. I am interest in how AI can play games and 
      how games can be used to study AI.

      <p >General Video Game Playing (GVGP)</p>
  </h3>

  <p>
    GVGP seeks to answer if an agent trained on some levels can work well on new levels.
    A novel reinforcement learning technique with dual-observation is proposed for general video game playing,
     assuming that it is more likely to observe similar local information in different levels rather than global information. 
     Instead of directly inputting a single, raw pixel-based screenshot of the current game screen, our proposed general technique takes the encoded, 
     transformed global and local observations of the game screen as two simultaneous inputs, aiming at learning local information for playing new levels.

    <p >Investigation on Game-based platforms</p>

  <!-- <img src="/images/projects/gplatform_gen.png" alt="gplatform_gen"> -->
</h3>
<p>
  Games have been the perfect test-beds for artificial intelligence research for the characteristics that widely exist in real-world scenarios. 
  Learning and optimisation, decision making in dynamic and uncertain environments, game theory, planning and scheduling, design and education are common research areas shared between games and real-world problems. 
  Numerous open-source games or game-based environments have been implemented for studying artificial intelligence. 
  In addition to single- or multi-player, collaborative or adversarial games, there has also been growing interest in implementing platforms for creative design in recent years. 
  Those platforms provide ideal benchmarks for exploring and comparing artificial intelligence ideas and techniques. 
  This paper reviews the game-based platforms for artificial intelligence research, discusses the research trend induced by the evolution of those platforms, 
  and gives an outlook.

<p>
  Applying games in AI education is a promising approach to improve students' learning experience and outcomes. 
  Beginners can learn AI concepts and techniques in a fun and interactive way, while advanced students can gain hands-on experience in solving real-world problems.

    <p >Single-agent robot controlling via evolutionary contrained reinforcement learning</p>

</h3>
<p>

  Evolutionary algorithms have been used to evolve a population of actors to generate diverse experiences for training reinforcement learning agents, 
  which helps to tackle the temporal credit assignment problem and improves the exploration efficiency. However, when adapting this approach to address constrained problems,
   balancing the trade-off between the reward and constraint violation is hard. In this paper, we propose a novel evolutionary constrained reinforcement learning (ECRL) algorithm, 
   which adaptively balances the reward and constraint violation with stochastic ranking, and at the same time, restricts the policy's behaviour by maintaining a set of
    Lagrange relaxation coefficients with a constraint buffer.
