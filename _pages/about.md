I am Chengpeng Hu, currently a PhD student with Eindhoven University of Technology, supervised by  <a href='https://www.hendrikbaier.com'>Dr. Hendrik Baier </a>. I obtained B.E. and M.E. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), under the supervision of <a href = 'http://www.liujialin.tech/index.html'> Dr. Jialin Liu </a> and <a href = 'https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/faculty/~xiny/'>Prof. Xin Yao </a>, with <a href = 'https://aingames.cn/'> Learning and Optimization in Games (LOG) Group</a> and <a href = 'https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/faculty/~xiny/'>OPtimization And Learning (OPAL) laboratory </a>. 

</p>

I am insterested in applying (single-/multi-agent, constrained) reinforcemnet learning and evolutionary computations for decision-making problems such as robotics, game, routing and scheduling for safety, generalisation and robutness.

My research areas include:
* Game AI
    * General video game playing: Train AI agents to play on unseen levels
    * Game for AI education
* Real-time controlling with safty guarantee (torque, collision, energy)
    * Robotic controlling via reinforcement learning
    * Multi-robot task allocation: Path finding with unlabelled targets
* Smart Logistics
    * Apply AI techinques to real world optimisation problems in logistics such as vehicle routing problem and dynamic material handling
    * Learning-based methods (reinforcement learning) for scheduling automated guided vehicles with safety constraints
